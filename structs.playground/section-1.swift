/******** NOTES

Value types vs. reference types -> swift provides two fundamentally different types:
-value types
-reference types

....REFERENCES TYPES...

NSMutableArray *array1 = [@[@(5), @(8), @(2)] mutableCopy];
NSMutableArray *array2 = array1;
[array1 addObject:@(10)];
// array1: [5,8,2,10]
// array2: [5,8,2,10]

As we see, if we change the array object through either of these two variables, the same
array object is modified

.....VALUE TYPES....

var array1 = [5,8,2]
var array2 = array1
array1.append(10)
// array1: [5,8,2,10]
// array2: [5,8,2]

When a value type is assigned to a variable, the variable always stores the value itself,
not a reference to a value. This means whenever a value is assigned to a new variable,
the new varaible gets its own copy of the value --> a value can always only have one owner.


-In Swift structs are value types and also arrays are implemented as structs.
That means they can only have one owner and are always copied when asssigned to a new variable
or sent to a method or function.

-BENEFITS OF USING VALUE TYPES (structs) --> code inherently safer, making changes to a struct
will not affect other parts of the program. For this reason most of the Swift standard libraries
use structs instead of classes.


-Classes are reference types.
