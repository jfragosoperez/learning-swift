When working with optional values, you can write ? before operations like methods, 
properties, and subscripting. If the value before the ? is nil, everything after 
the ? is ignored and the value of the whole expression is nil. Otherwise, the 
optional value is unwrapped, and everything after the ? acts on the unwrapped 
value. In both cases, the value of the whole expression is an optional value.
